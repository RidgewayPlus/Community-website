## For Beta/Release Preview

If you found your channel wass Beta or Release Preview, opting out of Insider updates should be as easy as turning on a switch.

Restart your PC and you should be opted out.

## For Dev

If you are in Dev channel, you need to pay attention to the build number, as it will affect whether you can leave Insiders without a clean install.

### Determine your current build

Press the "Windows" and "R" key simultaneously on the keyboard, type `winver` and press Enter, an "About Windows" window will appear.

>   **NOTE:** If the **Go back** option is disabled, a clean install is required, see [Installing Windows 10](installing_windows_10.md) for instructions to do so.

3. Follow the instructions on-screen to go back to a previous build.

4. Check your build again.

   If `winver` reports a build number starting with `22000`, follow the instructions for 22000.xxx above.

   If not, then unfortunately a clean install is required, see [Installing Windows 10](installing_windows_10.md) for instructions to do so.
